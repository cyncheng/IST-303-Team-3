### Application concept:
We are building a virtual version of the popular board game Monopoly, to be played by between 2 and 4 players through python. During the quarantine, this game is a fun but socially distanced way to socialize with friends. Using randomness generators and graphical interfaces within python, we can create a virtual simulation of the game that stays true to the original while being quicker and easier.

### Stakeholders
Players who are into classic board games. New players who are looking for digital board games to play and also spend time with their respective olayers.  

### User stories 
1. **User welcome page** - priority _##_ - _#_ days

2. **Set number of players** - priority _##_ - _#_ days
   - As a user I can set the number of players.  
3. **Roll dice** - priority _##_ - _#_ days
   - As a user, I can roll the dice and move around the board. 
4. **Choose character token** - priority _##_ - _#_ days
   - As a user, I am able to pick character to represent me.  
5. **Banker selection** - priority _##_ - _#_ days

#### Decomposition of user stories 

##### _xx_ days,priority _##_
1. As a user, I can see a welcome page when I first logged on.  The welcome page allows me to sign in or register. 

##### _xx_ days, priority _##_
2. As a user, after the game start I MUST be able to enter the number of players [between 2 and 4]. 
If I press Cancel, then I MUST be able to exit the game.

##### _xx_ days, priority _##_
3. As a player, I must be allowed to roll the dice and move my characters around the board, clockwise. 
Roll the dice to see who goes first. This highest roll begins the game 

##### _xx_ days, priority _##_
4. A player I must be able to pick or choose a token to represent me on the board.

##### _xx_ days, priority _##_
5. As a user I must be able to create a bank and identify one player to be the banker.
