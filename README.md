### Application concept: (Aary)
We are building a virtual version of the popular board game Monopoly, to be played by between 2 and 4 players through python. During the quarantine, this game is a fun but socially distanced way to socialize with friends. Using randomness generators and graphical interfaces within python, we can create a virtual simulation of the game that stays true to the original while being quicker and easier.

### User stories (christine)
1. User welcome page  ## - # days
   - As a user I can...
2. User story 2 - priority ## - # days
   - As a user I can...
3. User story 3 - priority ## - # days
4. User story 4 - priority ## - # days
5. User story 5 - priority ## - # days

#### Decomposition of user stories (Pete)
1. As a user, after the game start I MUST be able to enter the number of players [between 2and 4]. 
If I press Cancel, then I MUST be able to exit the game.
# days, priority ##
   - TBD
2. As a player, I must be allowed to roll the dice and move my characters around the board, clockwise. 
Roll the dice to see who goes first. This highest roll begins the game 
# days, priority ##
   - TBD
3. A player I must be able to pick or choose a token to represent me on the board.
# days, priority ##
4.As a user I must be able to create a bank and identify one player to be the banker
